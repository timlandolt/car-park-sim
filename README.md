# Exercise 01: Car Park Simulation
A school assignment in which we have to simulate a multi-storey car park. We have to use java and design suitable UML diagrams for it.

## The Task
> **You are developing a car park simulation. This supports the following functionalities:**
> - The entrance barrier opens when you have taken a ticket. You only get a ticket if there are still free spaces available.
> - Pay the parking price (price per minute) at one of the pay stations on the floors.
> - Exit the car park at one of the two exit barriers. The barrier will only open if the ticket has been paid for.
> - Show on the display in front of the car park how many spaces are still free.
>
> **1. develop this simulation as a console application in Java in a git repository.**
>
> **2. draw the necessary/meaningful UML diagrams.**
